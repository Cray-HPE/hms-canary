      summary: Kubernetes liveness endpoint to monitor service health
      x-private: true
      description: >-
        The `liveness` resource works in conjunction with the Kubernetes liveness
        probe to determine when the service is no longer responding to
        requests.  Too many failures of the liveness probe will result in the
        service being shut down and restarted.  


        This is primarily an endpoint for the automated Kubernetes system.

      description: >-
        The `readiness` resource works in conjunction with the Kubernetes readiness
        probe to determine when the service is no longer healthy and able to respond
        correctly to requests.  Too many failures of the readiness probe will result
        in the traffic being routed away from this service and eventually the service
        will be shut down and restarted if in an unready state for too long.
